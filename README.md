WOOO! First game of the new year! (first full game, really)

This is going to be the first of 12 games I make this year, one each month.
It's a cute little game where you play against friends on little planets, trying to blow each other up.
Heavily inspired by Sagittarius by George Prosser, so I'd definitely recommend checking him out at https://gprosser.itch.io/

Also, check out [Separate_Shelter](https://www.reddit.com/user/Separate_Shelter), who made the background music, and [salty_bac0n](https://twitter.com/salty_bac0n), who will be making the art for  future projects!
